## Tagging fields in LookML

A common reporting requirement is grouping fields under headings, and abbreviating column headers when many columns are present. This can be repetitive work! The Report Table vis will pick up tags in the LookML model, with the format `"vis-tools:SETTING:VALUE"`.

The current tag settings available are `heading` and `short_name`.

    measure: number_of_transactions {
      tags: [
        "vis-tools:heading:Transaction Value",
        "vis-tools:short_name:Volume",
        "vis-tools:unit:#"
      ]
      type: count
      value_format_name: decimal_0
      drill_fields: [transaction_details*]
    }

## Notes

- Maximum of two pivot fields
- Subtotals calculated at the front end are only for simple sums & averages
  - e.g. no Count Distincts, running totals, measures of type "number" with arbitrary calculations
  - The vis will use subtotals from the query response if available
